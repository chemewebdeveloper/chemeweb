			<h3>Why Should I Choose It As A Major?</h3>
			
			<p>Chemical engineering is the analysis or design of chemical 
			systems to effectively convert materials into more useful materials 
			or into energy. It has the following features:</p>
	<h3>A Versatile Degree</h3>
			<p> A Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering from BYU is a great degree
	 to have to stay competitive in the 21st century for the following reasons:</p>

				<li><h3>It touches every aspect of our lives</h3>  There is hardly a 
				single moment of the day when you are not in contact with, surrounded 
				by, or influenced by products that are a result of chemical engineering.
				 Just a few examples include clothing (fabric and dyes), paint, paper,
				  plastics, soaps, cosmetics, food products, medications, and semiconductors.</li>
				<li><h3>It is extremely versatile</h3> Chemical engineering combines
				 mathematics with the three basic physical sciences : chemistry, physics,
				  and biology, which can be used to describe nearly all physical phenomena.
				   Because of this versatility, chemical engineers make valuable 
				   contributions in a very broad spectrum of fields, from food processing
				    to semiconductor fabrication and from oil refining to artificial-organ
				     development.</li>
				<li><h3>It leads to many kinds of careers</h3> Chemical engineering
				 is an excellent preparation to go to: 1) work with a Bachelors degree,
				  2) graduate school in chemical engineering, 3) law school, 4) business
				   school, 5) medical school, and 6) full-time motherhood and homemaking
				    (yes, ChE helps there as well)</li>
				<li><h3>It addresses today's pressing problems</h3> The powerful tools 
				of chemical engineering provide leadership in attacking the most vital
				 and challenging issues of our day, including:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>generating energy</li>
				<li>saving the environment</li>
				<li>advancing biomedicine</li>
				<li>developing electronics</li>
				<li>enhancing food production</li>
				<li>improving materials</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>It is challenging and rewarding</h3> 
					<p>Chemical engineers 
				deal with exciting new problems daily and are called upon to employ 
				innovation in creating new technologies and solving problems in 
				existing technologies.They also receive among the highest salaries 
				for college graduates.</p>
				<h3>Come and talk with us!</h3>
					<p>One way to learn more about chemical
				 engineering is to come and talk to us! Faculty members are available
				  to visit with potential students who would like to learn more about
				   what we do. In addition the Department of Chemical Engineering at 
				   BYU has produced a video about the program and the profession that 
				   we would be happy to share with you. Come in to the department office
				    at 350 Clyde Building and we will be happy to let you watch it and 
				    help you evaluate your interest.</p>
			<h3>Are you up for a Challenge?</h3>
				<p>Another very good way to obtain a greater 
				understanding of the chemical engineering field and to determine your
				 interest and aptitude for this field is to enroll in the BYU course
				  Ch En 170, Introduction to Chemical Engineering, in either Fall or
				   Winter semester. Students in the class become familiar with the
				    bref
				    adth of chemical engineering and our unique approach to solving
				     problems. Students also get the rewarding experience of working 
				     on an open-ended design project. The textbook was written by two 
				     BYU ChemE faculty members and is now being used by other 
				     universities as well. After completing the course, students
				      often remark that they have a much better understanding of 
				      what chemical engineering is all about and have a better idea
				       as to their interest and potential to succeed in the field.</p>
