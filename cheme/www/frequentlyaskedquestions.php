			 <h2><a name="howmanycredits">How many credits should I take per semester?</a></h2>
	 	<p>A credit load of 14-16 credit hours is generally a healthy
	 	 full-time academic load for a semester, and we recommend not 
	 	 exceeding those numbers. (Note: for Spring or Summer terms,
	 	  which compress a semester into half the time, 7-8 credits is a
	 	   recommended maximum.) Further, you will learn that technical 
	 	   courses (e.g. science, math, and engineering) require more work 
	 	   and time than many other courses, so the full-time loads recommended 
	 	   above should usually include at least one non-technical class per semester.</p>
<h2><a name="job">Is a part-time job really a bad idea?</a></h2>
	A full academic load in chemical engineering requires a great deal of your time 
	and effort. In fact, when considering the time for classes, studies, assignments,
	 and the daily activities of life (sleep, hygiene, meals, exercise, and spiritual 
	 food), it's a full-time life! Depending on the number of credit hours that you take
	  in a semester, the remaining "free" time available for such activities as a job are
	   very limited (usually less than 10 hours/week).  If your financial situation 
	   requires you to work, you may need to reduce your academic load accordingly.
	    The following formula provides an approximate guideline for the maximum number 
	    of hours you should commit to a job (it may need to be reduced to accommodate
	     job preparation and travel time):<br /><br />
        Maximum Work Hours per Week  =  60 - 3.5 x Credit Hours<br /><br />
      Caution! Don't let your experience in high school and/or a community college 
      tempt you to underestimate the time you will need to be successful in chemical
       engineering at BYU. It is a common (and painful) mistake made by many new students.
        Adhere to the above formula for at least your first year. Then, you will know
         better how to adjust this formula for your own personal circumstances.</p>
 <h2><a name="freshmanclasses">If I am a Freshman and I want to major in Chemical Engineering, what classes
    should I begin taking?</a></h2>
    	<p>Registration in the correct classes is important to avoid delaying graduation
    	 by a year or two. The class schedule in the BYU Chemical Engineering Department
    	  is very full, and requires four full years of course work. Meet with a faculty
    	   advisor in our department to help avoid unnecessary delays in graduation! The 
    	   secretaries in the Chemical Engineering Department office can provide the name
    	    of your advisor, and you can then contact that advisor by phone or email
    	     (available in the <a href="Faculty.php">Faculty Directory</a>). You may want 
    	     to look at the flow charts that are suggested sequences for taking courses below.
    	     </p><br />
    	     <a href="images/prospective/flowchart_copy.png"><img 
    	     src="images/prospective/flowchart.png" style="border:3px solid #036;margin-right:auto;margin-left

    	     <p>Most important, because of the required sequences of courses in the
    	      very structured chemical engineering major, it is important that you
    	       begin right away (your first semester) with the following courses
    	        (unless you have AP credit for them):</p>
    	    <table style="margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto"><br />
    	    <th>Entry Level Classes</th>
    	    <tr>
    	    <td>Chemical Engineering (ChEn 170 or ChEn 191)</td>
    	    </tr>
    	    <tr>
    	    <td>Chemistry (Chem 111 or Chem 105)</td>
    	    </tr>
    	    <tr>
             <td>Calculus (Math 112)</p>
             </tr>
             </table><br />
    	    <p>Note that we would prefer that you take ChEn 191 and ChEn 170 in 
    	    alternating semesters so that we have contact with you each semester.
    	     If possible, we recommend that you take ChEn 191 the first semester,
    	      since this course is intended to help students understand the university
    	       and the department systems. ChEn 170 could then easily be taken in the
    	        Winter semester.</p>
  <h2><a name="apcourses">How do I know if AP courses I have taken are given credit at BYU?</a></h2>
    <p>Many incoming students have AP credit for Math, Chemistry, English, 
    and/or Physics. The University materials that you received should have 
    told you the specific BYU courses for which you have been given credit. 
    You can also look at the <a href="http://saas.byu.edu/tools/b4byu/sites/b4/?new-freshman/apib-guides/">
    BYU website explaining AP credit</a>. Initial questions 
    regarding AP credit should be directed to the <a href="http://www.et.byu.edu/college-advisement-center-0">
    Advisement Center</a> for the College of Engineering. Having AP credit
     in required classes allows students to take 
     other classes normally not taken until later, thereby reducing the otherwise-heavy
      course loads in later semesters. Your advisor can help you decide which classes
       to take early.</p>
  <h2><a name="ge">Are there any classes that double as a GE Requirement and a Major
    Requirement?</a></h2>
    <p>The university's general education program (University Core) is designed
     to broaden your education and enrich your experience at the university. However, 
     because of the large number of courses required for graduation in chemical 
     engineering, it is desirable to be as efficient as possible in fulfilling course
      requirements. A full description of the current GE program can be found under the 
      link "University Core" in the <a href="http://saas.byu.edu/classSchedule/">
      Class Schedule</a> and should be studied carefully.  
      However, the following guidelines show the most efficient plan for satisfying
       the GE core:</p>

            <p>Note: Any course (or combination of courses) that fulfills 
            the University Core requirement for "Biological Science" may be 
            substituted for Bio 100 except PWS 100.
            <p>Note: Prior to the 2010-2011 catalog year, the Major 
            requirement satisfying the Social Sicence GE was Econ 110.  </p>

    <h2><a name="transfer">What classes should I sign up for as a new transfer student?</a></h2>
   	 <p>If you have one or more semesters of college credit (not just AP credit) and you 
         are being admitted to BYU as a transfer student, then you probably wonder what classes
         to take your first semester or two at BYU. Actually, to answer that question it may be 
         necessary to plan out additional semesters. Some of your academic credit from 
         courses taken at your previous university will satisfy major and general
         requirements at BYU, creating a very customized schedule for your individual 
         case. Furthermore, chemical engineering is a busy program with less flexibility
         than you might imagine, and every semester affects the others. So, not taking 
         a critical course in a particular semester may end up delaying your graduation.</p>
   	 <p>Before you register for classes your first semester at BYU should should seek 
         the advice of the transfer credit coordinator, who will also become your academic advisor
         for the remainder of your degree program at BYU. This faculty member will help you customize 
         your schedule to meet your needs and optimize your progress toward graduation.
