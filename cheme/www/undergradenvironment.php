			 Department of Chemical Engineering is vitally concerned about the
			  education of undergraduate students.  The following environmental 
			  features reflect that concern</p>
		<h3>You will have a faculty advisor</h3>
			<p>Every student is assigned an advisor immediately upon entering the 
			department and is required to visit with that advisor and review his/her
			 progress toward graduation at least twice during his/her academic career.
			  The faculty try to maintain an open-door policy to students, and you are 
			  encouraged to visit your advisor as often as you would like.</p>
		<h3>The faculty teach all the classes</h3>
			<p>The faculty of the department personally teach all of the classes, as
			 opposed to turning them over to Teaching Assistants. To be sure, there are
			  Teaching Assistants for the classes, and they help with the tutoring of
			   students and with the grading of work, but they very rarely act as the
			    main teacher for the class. </p>
		<h3>Faculty-student interaction is positive</h3>
            <p>Classes are relatively small, ranging from the largest freshman 
            class of approximately 100 students down to the smaller specialty 
            classes of around 10-15, thus helping to promote interaction among 
            students and between students and faculty.  Furthermore, the faculty 
            generally learn the names of their students early in each semester, 
            even in the freshman class of 100, and work to foster an atmosphere 
            of friendship and brotherhood.  Excellence in teaching is promoted, 
            and student learning is enhanced by innovative methods, quality 
            laboratories, and the participation of undergraduates in faculty 
            research programs.</p>
        <h3>The major is challenging, but rewards are great</h3>
        	<p>The chemical engineering program is very rigorous, requiring
        	 focus and effective study habits. Students are required to take 
        	 classes in chemistry, calculus, physics, and chemical engineering.
        	  Those who dedicate focused study time, diligently seek to understand,
        	   and use the available resources (faculty, teaching assistants,
        	    student groups, etc.) become more effective learners and problem 
        	    solvers and find great success and satisfaction in the journey. 
        	    Furthermore, graduates in chemical engineering become valuable 
        	    citizens and leaders in their community, enjoy satisfying and 
        	    challenging careers, and are well compensated financially.</p>
        	<p>The undergraduate program, which is fully accredited by the Accreditation 
        	Board for Engineering and Technology, is one of the finest in the United States.</p>
