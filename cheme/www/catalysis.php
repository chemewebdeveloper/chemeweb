			<p>Dr. William Pitt, in conjunction with Dr. Dean Wheeler of Chemical Enginee
			ring and Dr. Gary Watt of Chemistry at BYU, is developing biocatalysts that

			electricity. The catalysts are from the viologen family of redox molecules. 
			Dr. Pitt and his students are attaching various types of viologens to 
			conductive graphite surfaces for use in fuel cells.</p>
