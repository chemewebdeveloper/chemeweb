					<h3>Research</h3>
							<!-- Insert paragraph here. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH</p> -->
							<p>The are three objectives in my research: 1) to perform comparative studies on commercial silicone hydrogel (SiHy) contact lenses, and lens care solutions to evaluate their effectiveness, 2) to develop a manufacturing process to load phospholipid into SiHy lenses to improve wear comfort, and 3) to identify possible comfort agents that can be added to lens formulations without affecting the clarity of lens significantly.

							Research findings:
							1) SiHy materials sorb much less protein but relatively more lipid compared to conventional hydrogel lenses.
							2) The efficiencies of mutipurpose lens care solutions (MPS) on reduction of lipid deposition are somewhat dependent on lens material.</p>
