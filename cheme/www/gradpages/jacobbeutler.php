						<h3>Biography</h3>
		 			<!-- Insert Short Biography here. Insert between <p> and </p>. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH HERE</p>-->
							<p>I grew up working on both dairy and crop farms in Dayton, ID. While studying for my B.S. in Chemical Engineering at BYU, I worked in the Central Heating Plant and developed an interest in Combustion. Because of the prominent 		 	                     combustion research performed at BYU, I decided to stay at BYU to pursue a PhD degree. I met and married my wife at BYU and now have four wonderful children. Upon completion of my PhD degree, I hope to continue doing energy                          research.</p>

					<h3>Research</h3>
							<!-- Insert paragraph here. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH</p> -->
							<p>An increasing emphasis on mitigating global climate change (global warming) over the last few decades has created interest in a broad range of sustainable or alternative energy systems to replace fossil fuel combustion. Co-firing biomass with coal in traditional large-scale coal power plants represents one of the lowest risk, least costly, near-term methods of CO2 mitigation. Simultaneously, it is one of the most efficient and inexpensive uses of biomass. Biomass gasification also represents a means for CO2 friendly syngas for either power production, liquid fuel production, or chemical productions.
							This research focuses on increasing understanding of biomass combustion and gasification. For the first time, we have successfully mapped out velocity fields and gas and particle compositions in the near burner region of several co-fired flames in a full-scale multi-burner boiler. This data set provides a comparison to CFD when testing separate kinetic or turbulent models.
							Currently we are experimentally measuring atmospheric gasification rates of single biomass particles. These experiments will be used to regress gasification kinetic parameters for power law model expressions. Simultaneously a biomass combustion/gasification that accounts for intra particle composition and temperature gradients is being improved for future utility in CFD.</p>
