						<h3>Biography</h3>
		 			<!-- Insert Short Biography here. Insert between <p> and </p>. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH HERE</p>-->
							<p>I was born in Utah, but grew up in New Mexico (a relatively ugly place, but fantastic for playing capture the flag). I graduated from High School there and went to BYU-Idaho for a short time before I served a Mission in the Taiwan, Taipei mission. I returned to BYU Provo, where I married my wife and graduated with my bachelors degree in chemical engineering. I know have two children with one on the way. I enjoy playing ice hockey and wood carving. </p>

					<h3>Research</h3>
							<!-- Insert paragraph here. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH</p> -->
							<p>Global climate change has sparked debates about carbon dioxide emissions. Dr. Baxter and his startup company Sustainable Energy Solutions have developed a new and efficient method for cryogenically capturing carbon dioxide from coal power plants' flue gas, called Cryogenic Carbon Capture (CCC). A crucial unit in this process is a heat exchanger that can desublimate CO2 from a gas mixture. My research focuses on developing and analyzing a desublimating fluidized bed heat exchanger. This heat exchanger desublimates CO2 onto a heat transfer surface, and then removes the solid CO2 from the surface via fluidized particles. Current results show that a portion of the solid CO2 is indeed removed from the heat transfer surface, and that both heat and mass transfer are significantly increased due to fluidized particles. </p>
