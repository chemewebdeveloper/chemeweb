					<h3>Research</h3>
							<!-- Insert paragraph here. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH</p> -->
							<p>One of the foremost technical barriers to the successful, economical practice of Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is uncertainty regarding catalyst life. Understanding the chemistry of deactivation pathways and modeling catalyst deactivation rates are imperatives to the design of more stable catalysts and the development of robust, realistic reactor models which facilitate FT reactor/process design and optimization. Since process optimization relies on a knowledge of catalyst performance, the ability to predict catalyst life enables planning for shutdown and regeneration thereby lowering operating costs.
							Causes of catalyst deactivation in FTS are largely qualitatively understood. They include loss of activity due to poisoning by contaminants (e.g. sulfur compounds), deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface, oxidation of active phase and sintering of the active phase and support. The poisoning can be addressed through the use of guard beds, while sintering rates can be reduced by temperature management in the reactor. Carbon deposition on FT catalysts, however, is not sufficiently quantitatively understood to effectively enable its management. For example, effects of partial pressures of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) (the reactants in FTS) on the deactivation rate are not quantitatively understood.
							My work has three main objectives, namely 1) develop an active, selective, and stable cobalt catalyst 2) study reaction and deactivation rates as a function of reactant partial pressures and temperature to enable rate model development, and 3) develop a microkinetic model of the kinetics of deactivation. To date, our research success is preparation of Fe catalyst which is more active than any supported Fe FT catalysts reported in the literature.</p>
