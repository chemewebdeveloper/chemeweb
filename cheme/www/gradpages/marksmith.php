					<h3>Research</h3>
							<!-- Insert paragraph here. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH</p> -->
							<p>Mark works in the Bundy Biotech Lab, which utilizes cell-free protein synthesis to produce novel protein constructs through genetic and post-translational modifications. Mark specifically works with virus-like particles and is attempting to engineer them for high-speed/high-resolution single particle tracking. A manuscript by Mark and coworkers regarding protein-immobilization and genetic modifications allowing for single-site attachment has recently been accepted for publication in the journal Biotechnology Progress (Nov 2012).</p>
