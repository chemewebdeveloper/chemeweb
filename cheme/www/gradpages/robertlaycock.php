							<h3>Biography</h3>
			 			<!-- Insert Short Biography here. Insert between <p> and </p>. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH HERE</p>-->
								<p>I grew up on a small farm near Raymond, Alberta, Canada. I spent the first 18 years of my life on the farm and then moved down to Provo in 2002 to attend Brigham Young University, where I received my BS in Chemical Engineering. I also spent 2 years from 2003 to 2005 serving an LDS mission in France where I loved the sites and people. I am now working on receiving my PhD in Chemical Engineering. My research interests are energy and combustion related, with my dissertation focusing on ash deposition in syngas turbines.</p>

						<h3>Research</h3>
								<!-- Insert paragraph here. Example: <p>INSERT PARAGRAPH</p> -->
								<p>Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), where coal-derived syngas is burned in a gas turbine, is one attempt to combine the efficiency of gas turbines with the abundance of coal. One problem with this technology is surface degradation due to the presence of coal ash in the gas stream. The coal-derived syngas, even after cleaning and filtration, contains small amounts (~0.1 ppmw) of ash particulate which heats up and deposits on turbine blades and components. By conducting experiments in the Turbine Accelerated Deposition Facility at BYU, my research looks at the effect of exposure time, gas temperature, surface temperature, film-cooling, and ash composition on the rate of deposition and the physical and chemical characteristics of the ash deposits. Gas temperatures in these experiments reach up to 1400°C.
								One important parameter that we look at is the capture efficiency, or the ratio of the mass of ash deposited on our samples to the mass of ash fed into our system. We have shown that as exposure time increases, for a constant particle loading, the capture efficiency increases exponentially. Surface roughness and deposit thickness, however, increase linearly with increased exposure time.</p>
