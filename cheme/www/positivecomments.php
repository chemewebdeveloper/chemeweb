		<h3>Celanese</h3>
			<p>Brigham Young University has placed a number of engineering graduates 
			at Celanese, a Fortune 500 technology and specialty material company.
			 Celanese really values BYU’s Chemical Engineering graduates. 
			 They are smart, globally agile, have technology savvy and also 
			 understand leadership fundamentals and can make an immediate impact
			  on Celanese’s business operations.  BYU is gaining a well deserved
			   reputation for training engineers who are equipped to lead global 
			   teams in solving significant technical challenges.<br /><br />

		<h3>ExxonMobil Corporation</h3>
            <p>ExxonMobil recruits from only the best Universities that consistently
             deliver top engineering talent for our corporation. The engineers we hire
              are tracked throughout their careers and their long-term success with the
               company is one very important factor in whether their school remains on
                our list of recruited schools... ExxonMobil has been recruiting engineers
                 from BYU for over 40 years uninterrupted -- and we continue to be pleased
                  with the caliber of engineers that have emerged from the BYU program. 
                  In fact, we have expanded the scope of recruiting at BYU over the years
                   while some other universities, even those that have managed to stay on
                    our recruiting list, have seen a reduction in ExxonMobil's 
                    recruiting efforts... Every year all engineers that work for 
                    ExxonMobil are evaluated based on their performance and ranked 
                    in seriatim fashion without regard to what school they attended. 
                    The BYU engineers are consistently competitive in those rankings. <br /><br />

        <h3>Dow Chemical Company</h3>
        	<p>I recruited Chemical Engineering students from BYU for The Dow Chemical
        	 Company for approximately 20 years... I can tell you that BYU Chemical
        	  Engineering students stack up against any other school in the country
        	   and the top chemical and oil companies in America seek after BYU students.<br />
   Leading Chemical companies like Dow Chemical have strong company cultures based on 
   hard work, professionalism, integrity, trustworthiness, leadership, tenacity,
    innovation, communication and teamwork. BYU students (many of whom are returned
     missionaries) bring an abundance of these characteristics and therefore are highly
      sought after. The average university alumni chemical engineers at Dow have 
      approximately 10 percent of their members in leadership roles, but BYU 
      chemical engineer alumni averaged almost 40% of their members in leadership
       roles at Dow during the last survey I completed. That means that a BYU 
       chemical engineer may be 4 times more likely to end up in leadership 
       roles during their career, no wonder they are so highly sought after.<br />
     The BYU Chemical Engineering educational program is as good as any in the US of 
     which I am aware... If I were starting my career over, I would not hesitate for
      one moment to come to BYU for a great educational program and a wonderful 
      selection of companies to choose from to start my career.<br /><br />

        <h3>Graduate School</h3>
         	<p>BYU offers more opportunities for meaningful undergraduate
         	 research than any place I know. I feel that I came to MIT with
         	  comparable academic skills (an understanding of the core ChemE
         	   subjects (Thermo, Transport, and Kinetics), but where I feel 
         	   far ahead of others is my ability to conceive of and execute novel
         	    research.... I visited five of the top graduate schools in
         	     Chemical Engineering as I tried to make my decision for where 
         	     I wanted to attend. At each school, the professors had nothing 
         	     but respect and admiration for their BYU students. We are well 
         	     respected in the graduate community...<br /><br />

         	 <p>...Dr Beaudoin, the professor at Purdue in charge of recruiting 
         	 grad students for chemical engineering ...mentioned that he would
         	  love to get several BYU students in each year, and that the caliber
         	   he has seen from BYU is outstanding from both his time at Arizona 
         	   State and now at Purdue with myself and now Mckay Easton.<br /><br />
