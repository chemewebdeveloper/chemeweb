			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">I</span></i></strong><i><b>nvest the time required to polish and update your resume.</b></i>  This may take a couple hours, but it will probably be the most productive time during your job search.  Your resume introduces you as a viable candidate.  It showcases your qualifications and demonstrates your   professionalism and thoroughness.  Update your resume at the start of the school year to include current   related courses as well as courses planned for later in the year.  This will be useful information for a   hiring manager and will reduce the need for updates to your resume during the school year.  As your   related academic and work experiences increase, shift the emphasis in your resume to your acquired   skills.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">M</span></i></strong><i><b>ake your resume &quot;scanner-friendly.&quot;</b></i>  Many companies, including Intel, use an electronic scanning system to process resumes.  To decrease   potential scanning errors, your resume should be in plain ASCII text format and should be on white or   off-white paper (no fax copies, please).  Please avoid bold type, underlining, italics, fancy type faces,   different font sizes and styles, graphics, and photos.  Examples of preferred type faces include Arial,   Courier, or Times New Roman 12-point font size.  It is best to prepare two versions of your resume: a   &quot;scanner-friendly&quot; version and a &quot;fancy-format&quot; version which is more appealing to the human eye.  You   may offer both versions to recruiters.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">C</span></i></strong><i><b>arefully check the spelling and accuracy, especially your name,   address, and phone number.</b></i> Include a nickname, if appropriate (e.g., &quot;Kristen Jean 'K.J.'   Johnson&quot;).  Use a spell-checker (this will catch most, but not all, spelling errors), then review   it line-by-line for any remaining errors.  It is also helpful to have someone else review it.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">A</span> </i></strong><i><b>one-page resume is preferred.</b></i>  If two pages are needed, the second page should have a header with your name and page number.  Do not use   a single sheet printed on both sides because many automated scanning devices cannot accommodate two-sided   copies.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">M</span></i></strong><i><b>ake it easy for us to reach you.</b></i>  Be certain that your resume lists your current address, phone number, e-mail address, and any other ways   to contact you (e.g. pager, phone number for messages, campus or office phone number).  If roommates or   relatives take messages for you, alert them to the importance of job-related calls.  If you have a web   site, include the URL on your resume (near your name and address).</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">L</span></i></strong><i><b>ist your primary academic credentials.</b></i>  Indicate your school(s), degree(s), major(s), and date(s) you did or will graduate (e.g. &quot;Brigham Young   University, MS Chemical Engineering, May 2000&quot;).</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">A</span></i></strong><i><b>lways include your overall GPA</b></i>  for each degree (e.g. &quot;Overall GPA: 3.3/4.0&quot;) because many managers will assume it is low if not   included.  Also list your major GPA or your recent GPA (e.g. &quot;Major GPA: 3.5/4.0&quot;, &quot;GPA since 1997:   3.6/4.0&quot;) if they are higher than your overall GPA.  Do not rely on a statement like &quot;graduated with   honors&quot; as a substitute for an actual GPA.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">L</span></i></strong><i><b>ist key academic courses and projects</b></i>  related to your career goals and highlight topics or lab work of special interest.  Also, list courses   that are important, though indirectly related to your goals (e.g. Technical Communications, Engineering   Management).</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">L</span></i></strong><i><b>ist your work experience.</b></i>  If a position is related to your current career goals, provide a couple of lines of specific details on   projects and responsibilities; otherwise, provide a brief summary.  Your resume should reflect both the   breadth and depth of your work experience since it is very often the deciding factor when managers compare   resumes.  For each position, include your job title and note whether it was full-time or part-time.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">I</span></i></strong><i><b>nclude keywords and phrases</b></i>  that describe your skills and experience (e.g. specific equipment, operating environments or software   applications, technical jargon, relevant acronyms, etc.).  Recruiters and managers regularly search our   database using keywords and phrases that describe the specific skills and knowledge required for a   particular opening.  Indicate on your resume any Intel products, architecture, or technology that you   have been exposed to and include the word &quot;Intel&quot; (e.g. &quot;Developed cache memory   simulations of a Pentium&reg; II processor using Intel assembly language under MS Windows 98&quot;).*  Do the same for other key companies' products, etc.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">H</span></i></strong><i><b>ighlight your computer skills.</b></i>  List the hardware platforms, programming languages, operating systems, and application software of which   you have working knowledge.  Managers (and their database queries) will not assume that you have   experience with PC's, Windows, UNIX, C++, Java, HTML, SPICE, VHDL, or any other technologies unless   they are included on your resume.*</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">H</span></i></strong><i><b>ighlight leadership and teamwork skills.</b></i>  List any work experience, project work, or outside activities that demonstrate these skills.  Indicate   leadership roles in professional societies (e.g. HKN, IEEE, SWE, NSBE, SHPE, AISES).  Volunteer   positions that reflect these skills may also be included.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">F</span></i></strong><i><b>ocus on pertinent information.</b></i>  Avoid including personal information that is not relevant to your ability to carry out job assignments.  However, do include information such as permanent right to work in the U.S., availability for   employment, geographical preferences, etc.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">D</span></i></strong><i><b>o not send other documents in support of your resume.</b></i>  Examples include transcripts, letters of reference, work performance reviews, school project reports,   sample of technical writing, abstracts of theses, dissertations or publications, etc.  You may offer   these in an interview or when meeting with a recruiter as they may assist in assessing your   qualifications and finding a suitable position for your skills.  However, please do not mail such   additional documents since only your resume and cover letter will be entered into our resume database.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">K</span></i></strong><i><b>eep an ample supply of your resume on hand.</b></i>  Bring copies of both a plain ASCII text version and a fancy-format version of your resume to all   recruiting and employer networking events, and keep a few copies with your at all times.  Don't hesitate   to offer your resume to anyone who might be able to help you find a suitable position, even outside of   formal recruiting events.</p>
			    </li>
			    <li>
			    <p><strong><i><span class="first">S</span></i></strong><i><b>ubmit an updated scanner-friendly resume</b></i>  whenever there are significant changes (e.g. new address, phone number, GPA, or work experience) and we   will update our database accordingly.  We prefer to receive resumes electronically as they are processed   more quickly and accurately.  E-mail your ASCII text resume to:</p>
