		<p style="margin:-250px 0px">Dr. Thomas H. Fletcher is a Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Brigham Young University. 
		He received a PhD in Chemical Engineering from BYU in 1983. He worked for seven years at the Combustion Research
		 Facility at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, California. He has been on the faculty at BYU since 1991, 
		 and is currently serving as Associate Chair. Dr. Fletcher is the Director of the Advanced Combustion Engineering 
		 Research Center (ACERC) at BYU, which performs about $2 million in research per year. He is a world expert in pyrolysis 
		 of coal and low-grade fuels, with more than 30 years of experience in coal research. His research interests include pyrolysis
		  and combustion of coal and biomass, NOx formation from low-grade fuels, coal gasification, oil shale chemistry, use of synfuels 
		  in gas turbines, fundamentals of wildland fire ignition, soot formation from aromatic compounds, lean premixed combustion, and laser diagnostics.</p>
