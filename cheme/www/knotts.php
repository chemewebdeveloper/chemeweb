		<br />
		<p>Dr. Knotts joined the faculty of Brigham Young University in the fall of 2006. 
		In his research, Dr. Knotts and his group use molecular simulation to investigate 
		the behavior of many systems of interests including proteins, DNA, biomolecule/surface 
		interactions, and carbon nanotubes. The group maintains a High Performance Computer 
		Cluster and heavily uses computational resources available at the Fulton Supercomputing 
		Laboratory at BYU.</p>
		<p>In keeping with the BYU tradition of undergraduate mentoring, Dr. Knotts advises both 
		graduate and undergraduate researchers. Each student participates in fundamental research,
		 and the group has a strong track record of student-led publications at both the graduate 
		 and undergraduate levels. </p>
		  <p>Dr. Knotts received his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from Brigham Young University
		   in 2001. He then travelled to Madison, WI to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison and
		    pursue graduate studies in the department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. He was 
		    advised by Dr. Juan J. de Pablo and graduated with his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering in 2006.</p>
