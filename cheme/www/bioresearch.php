						<p>Dr. Brad Bundy's lab works on protein engineering of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/btpr.744/asset/744_ftp.pdf;jsessionid=69BDAB19A232B7929904FC9BAE95A76D.d01t03?v=1&t=h79a04kw&s=9b8a01168da6bcfccddd3943139ce17bfddebd5e">Virus-like						
						Particles</a> for vaccine development, drug delivery, and imaging						
						applications.  Our recent paper focuses on the incorporation of a						
						single unique A2 protein into the Qbeta VLP which could then be used						
						as a unique site for bioconjugation of the desired biochemical moiety						
						to the particle.  Read about it in the link below.  Smith MT, Varner,						
						CT, Bush DB, and Bundy BC. 2011. The Incorporation of A2 Protein to						
						Produce Novel Qbeta Virus-like Particles using Cell-free Protein

					<h2>Biofuels from Biomass</h2><hr /><br />
			
							<img src="images/Department/biofuelsfrombiomass.png">
					
						<p>Dr. Lewis is conducting research on the conversion of biomass to biofuels. 
						 Specifically, he is focusing on the biological conversion of syngas (hydrogen,
						  carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide) to biofuels.  Syngas is generated via
						   the gasification of biomass.  The research involves (1) assessing the effects
						    of syngas impurities on the biological conversion process, (2) modeling 
						    the effects of syngas composition on enzyme efficiency, (3) optimizing 
						    the reactor design for the most efficient syngas conversion, and (4) 
						    developing methods to incorporate multiple biological processes to obtain
						     the most sustainable overall process.</p>

				<!-- <h2>Finding The Solutions</h2>
								<p colspan="2">Biomedical engineering is a prominent specialty of several engineering
								 fields, including chemical engineering. Specifically, biomedical engineering 
								 integrates physical, chemical, biological, mathematical, and computational 
								 principles to address medical problems. It creates knowledge from the molecular
								  to the organ system levels and develops innovative biologics, materials, processes,
								   implants, devices, and informatics for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment 
								   of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health.</p> -->

		
				
					<h2>Blood-Compatible Materials/Devices</h2><hr /><br />

				
							<img src="images/Department/blood-compatible.jpg">
					


						<p>Blood-biomaterial reactions cause blood platelets to accumulate into 
						"clumps" on biomaterial surfaces that can inhibit artificial organ function
						 and can break off into the bloodstream and block downstream blood capillaries.
						    Dr. Solen’s group experimentally studies the effects of hemodynamics and 
						    drugs on these phenomena using miniature flow cells monitored with 
						    videomicroscopy and laser light-scattering. They also use computer models
						     to predict blood-biomaterial interactions in medical devices, which may
						      help to refine device designs.</p>

					<h2>Transport in Contact Lenses</h2><hr /><br />

			
							<img src="images/Department/transportincontactlenses.jpg">
					


						<p>Dr. Pitt has been studying theoretical aspects of the transport
						 of oxygen and ions in soft contact lenses since 2006. Recently he 
						 and his students have conducting experiments on the transport of 
						 phospholipids in silicone hydrogel contact lenses, with the aim of
						  using the contact lens as a depot to slowly release phospholipids to
						   the tears bathing the cornea. This technology could be used to increase
						    the comfort of wearing contact lenses, particularly by people who lack
						     adequate phospholipids, and thus who often have dry or itching eyes.</p>

					<h2>Ultrasonic Activated Drug and Gene Delivery</h2><hr /><br />

			
							<img src="images/Department/ultrasonic.jpg">
				
						<p>Over the past decade we have found that anti-cancer drugs can
						 be sequestered inside small carrier vesicles that can be injected 
						 into the blood stream and travel throughout the body within the 
						 circulatory system, and then be released from the carrier at a 
						 precise location and timing using ultrasonic irradiation. The drug 
						 carriers keep the drug from being released prematurely and 
						 interacting with healthy tissues, resulting in side effects.
						  We are actively studying this method of drug delivery, and 
						  are designing drug carriers.</p>
