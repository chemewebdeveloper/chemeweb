		<h2>Reputation</h2>	
			<p>The Chemical Engineering Program at Brigham Young University 
			provides an exceptional atmosphere of academic and spiritual education
			 that enjoys a strong reputation. Here are a few illustrations dealing 
			 with a few of the many facets of that reputation.</p>
		<h2>BYU as a Whole</h2>
			<p>BYU ranks 7th nationally in number of undergraduates who go on for PhDs.
			 "The rank reflects BYU's focus on mentoring undergraduates and preparing 
			 them to succeed beyond BYU" (Salt Lake Tribune)</p>
			<p>ACT scores of all entering freshmen: 28 (among the highest in the nation
			 and significantly higher than most universities)</p>
            <p>BYU was ranked No. 11 in the country for schools whose graduates were the 
            top-rated by recruiters (The Wall Street Journal, September 20, 2010).
             In the list of "Top 25 Recruiter Picks," BYU ranked ahead of schools 
             such as Cornell, Cal-Berkeley, UCLA and MIT.</p>
        <h2>The BYU Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Program</h2>
        	<p>While chemical engineering departments are ranked occasionally, those 
        	rankings nearly always focus on the graduate program and research aspects 
        	of the department.  Undergraduate programs are seldom evaluated on a 
        	comparative national basis. However, the indicators in the links below 
        	suggest that the BYU Chemical Engineering undergraduate program is very 
        	effective and highly regarded.</p>

	<h2>Chemical Engineering Graduate Program</h2>
        <p>Even though BYU is primarily an undergraduate institution, the graduate
         program in Chemical Engineering is well respected.  Offering both M.S. and 
         Ph.D. degrees, the Chemical Engineering Dept. has enjoyed significant success 
         in educating its graduate students and contributing to the technical knowledge
          of our society.</p>
        <p>While many of those successes are such that they aren't publicized to the 
        general public, a few more visible events are noteworthy and are summarized
        as follows:</p>
        
        <h3>DIPPR</h3>
        	<p>The Department of Chemical Engineering at BYU was selected by the
        	 Design Institute for Physical Property Data (DIPPR), an organization 
        	 of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), to manage and
        	  upgrade its large database of thermophysical properties.  Managed by
        	   three Chemical Engineering faculty members at BYU, the project serves
        	    chemical companies all over the world and brings in $250,000 per year.
        	      The award will continue for an indefinite period of time.</p>
    	<h3>ACERC</h3>
    		<p>Under the direction of key Chemical Engineering faculty
    		 at BYU, the Advanced Combustion Engineering Research Center
    		  (ACERC) was founded in 1985 by the National Science Foundation
    		   (only 5 Engineering Research Centers were funded out of over 100 
    		   applications from major universities).  ACERC has brought in nearly 
    		   30 million dollars to BYU over the past 13 years.</p>
