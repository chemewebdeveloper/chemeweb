	<p colspan="2">Biomedical engineering is a prominent specialty of several engineering
	 fields, including chemical engineering. Specifically, biomedical engineering 
	 integrates physical, chemical, biological, mathematical, and computational 
	 principles to address medical problems. It creates knowledge from the molecular
	  to the organ system levels and develops innovative biologics, materials, processes,
	   implants, devices, and informatics for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment 
	   of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health.</p>

			<p>Blood-biomaterial reactions cause blood platelets to accumulate into 
			"clumps" on biomaterial surfaces that can inhibit artificial organ function
			 and can break off into the bloodstream and block downstream blood capillaries.
			    Dr. Solen’s group experimentally studies the effects of hemodynamics and 
			    drugs on these phenomena using miniature flow cells monitored with 
			    videomicroscopy and laser light-scattering. They also use computer models
			     to predict blood-biomaterial interactions in medical devices, which may
			      help to refine device designs.</p>

			<p>Dr. Pitt has been studying theoretical aspects of the transport
			 of oxygen and ions in soft contact lenses since 2006. Recently he 
			 and his students have conducting experiments on the transport of 
			 phospholipids in silicone hydrogel contact lenses, with the aim of
			  using the contact lens as a depot to slowly release phospholipids to
			   the tears bathing the cornea. This technology could be used to increase
			    the comfort of wearing contact lenses, particularly by people who lack
			     adequate phospholipids, and thus who often have dry or itching eyes.</p>

			<p>Over the past decade we have found that anti-cancer drugs can
			 be sequestered inside small carrier vesicles that can be injected 
			 into the blood stream and travel throughout the body within the 
			 circulatory system, and then be released from the carrier at a 
			 precise location and timing using ultrasonic irradiation. The drug 
			 carriers keep the drug from being released prematurely and 
			 interacting with healthy tissues, resulting in side effects.
			  We are actively studying this method of drug delivery, and 
			  are designing drug carriers.</p>
