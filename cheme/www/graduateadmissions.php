	<h2>Detailed Application Information&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

	<p>
		<strong>All applicants to the graduate program should apply online by following the steps at the BYU Graduate Studies</strong><strong> web site:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="http://graduatestudies.byu.edu/admissions-requirements" target="_blank"><strong>Instructions for U.S. Applicants<br />
			</strong></a></li>
		<li>
			<strong><a href="http://graduatestudies.byu.edu/application-instructions-int" target="_blank"><strong>Instructions for International Applicants</strong></a></strong></li>
	</ul>

<p>
	<a name="A_IntStud_Inst."></a> <strong>Please note: international students</strong> (those with a B.S. degree from a non-U.S. school) should provide to the department unofficial copies of their complete transcripts and diplomas for initial review.&nbsp; Physical copies may be mailed (see address below) by the student or electronic copies may be uploaded in the Department Documents section of the BYU online application.&nbsp; The student should complete all other steps of the online application, including submitting official GRE and TOEFL scores to BYU. If the department decides to recommend admission to the university, the department will request that the student send official transcripts to a credential evaluation agency and the department will pay the required evaluation fees to have the results sent to BYU.&nbsp; We adopted this policy as a courtesy to our applicants as the credential evaluation costs $100 or more and can take several weeks.&nbsp; In summary, international students are not required to provide official transcripts to the department for their applications to be complete at the time of the application deadline.</p>

<p>
	<strong>*</strong>Each year&#39;s entering class of graduate students is selected following the January 31 priority deadline.&nbsp; Applications completed after the priority deadline will be considered only if additional openings in our entering class become available.</p>
<p>
	The graduate program is organized so that Fall Semester is the normal starting time; we therefore will consider admission at other times of the year only for well-qualified applicants who are able to secure supplemental financial support from a potential faculty research advisor.</p>
<h2>
	&nbsp;<a name="A_requirements"></a>Application Requirements </h2>
<p>
	The Graduate Record Examination <a href="http://www.gre.org/">(GRE)</a> is required for all applicants. Applicants whose native language is not English are also required to take an English proficiency exam (such as TOEFL) as described on the <a href="http://www.byu.edu/gradstudies/admissions/englishtest.php" target="_blank">BYU Graduate Studies web page.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Average GRE scores from admitted students over the past five years, along with other program statistics are available at the BYU Graduate Studies web pages for our <a href="http://www.byu.edu/gradstudies/programs/formdetails.php?program=41&amp;submit=select" target="_blank">PhD</a> and <a href="http://www.byu.edu/gradstudies/programs/formdetails.php?program=42&amp;submit=select" target="_blank">MS</a> programs.</p>
<p>
	All applicants must have a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree in chemical engineering, in another field of engineering, or in a physical science.&nbsp; Students in the final year of their B.S. program who will complete the degree before their graduate school entrance date are included in this group.&nbsp; The most competitive applicants will have a chemical engineering B.S. with a minimum 3.0 GPA (4.0 scale) in upper-division chemical engineering courses and a minimum overall 3.3 GPA.</p>
<p>
	Applicants with a technical, non-chemical engineering background will be considered and are encouraged to apply.&nbsp; Students in these areas who are admitted to the program are generally required to take supplemental chemical engineering coursework during the first year of graduate school on a case-by-case basis. Such students may also be admitted on a provisional degree-seeking basis, in which their status is changed to regular degree-seeking once necessary background courses have been taken.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	<a name="A_financial_aid"></a>Financial Aid and Choosing an Advisor</h2>
<p>
	Every student in the chemical engineering graduate program receives financial aid in the form of a stipend (salary) and in many cases tuition support.&nbsp; This does not require a separate application.&nbsp; Each student accepted into the program will have his or her financial aid package specified in the offer letter.</p>
<p>
	Currently, the department pays full tuition for first-year Ph.D. students and partial tuition for second-year Ph.D. students.&nbsp; Most Ph.D. students take the bulk of their classes in the first two years and take fewer credits in later years.&nbsp; While the department does not guarantee tuition support after the first year, it is often available from faculty advisors through their research grants.&nbsp; The department does not currently provide tuition support for M.S. students.&nbsp; Tuition amounts can be found on the <a href="http://www.byu.edu/gradstudies/admissions/costsfinaid.php">Graduate Studies webpage</a>.</p>
<p>
	Nearly every student receives a stipend through a combination of research and teaching assistantships.&nbsp; The yearly stipend for students in 2011-2012 is $23,000 for Ph.D. students and $22,000 for M.S. students.&nbsp; These amounts are sufficient that most students can avoid accumulating debt in the form of student loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Choosing a faculty research advisor is one of the most important decisions for graduate students.&nbsp; In our program this decision is made <em>after</em> a student begins the program and after he or she has been able to interview at least six faculty members as potential advisors.&nbsp; This policy is designed to allow sufficient freedom for the best match between students and faculty.&nbsp; We encourage students to correspond with potential advisors before applying to and attending BYU.&nbsp; However, no binding commitments with respect to advisor can be made until after the student begins the graduate program.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	<a name="A_honor_code"></a>BYU Honor Code</h2>
<p>
	The BYU Honor Code establishes expected standards of honor, integrity, morality, and personal behavior for students, faculty and staff. &nbsp;All students, upon admission to BYU, are required to observe the standards of the BYU Honor Code at all times, whether on or off campus. &nbsp;A detailed description of the Honor Code can be found at the the <a href="http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php#HCOfficeInvovement" target="_blank">Honor Code Office website</a>. &nbsp;The Honor Code is an integral part of BYU and prospective students should be comfortable adhering to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ecclestiastical Endorsment</h2>
<p>All applicants for graduate study must receive an ecclesiastical endorsement before being recommended for admission.  
Endorsement information is provided on the <a href="http://graduatestudies.byu.edu/endorsement-information">Graduate Studies webpage</a>. Students who are not members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, should send email to INTL@byu.edu to have a telephone interview set up with the university chaplain who will explain the process and conduct the endorsement interview.</p>
