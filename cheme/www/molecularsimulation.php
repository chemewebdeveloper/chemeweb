<h3>Molecular Simulations</h3><br />
	<h3>The Core</h3>
	<p>Controlling the behavior of physical systems is at the core of chemical
	 engineering. The behavior observed on the macroscopic scale is the aggregate 
	 of countless interactions that occur at the molecular level.  An understanding
	  of what occurs on these small length scales enables prediction, manipulation, 
	  and control of the behavior of larger systems. Molecular modeling and simulation
	   consist of a suite of computational techniques that can be used to create
	    individual atoms and molecules in a virtual environment and "watch" what 
	    happens. With the resources available at the Fulton Supercomputing Laboratory 
	    at BYU, molecular simulation and modeling tools are used to investigate many
	     systems of interest including the phase behavior of fluids, the dynamics of
	      ion movement in fuel cells, the interactions of proteins on surfaces, and 
	      the prediction of thermophysical properties of industrially-relevant compounds.
	       Additionally, significant effort is devoted to development of novel tools,
	        algorithms, and theories.  Such are required as the problems being 
	        investigated are complex and unique.  Please visit the links below 
	        for more details.</p>

			<p>Proteins are involved in almost all aspects of life.
			  A protein begins as a long linear chain of amino acids 
			  but becomes a compact, three-dimensional structure in a 
			  process called "folding." Understanding the folding process
			   is one of the most important topics in modern biochemistry. 
			    Protein structure can be destroyed (a process called "denaturation" 
			    or "unfolding") using external influences such as pH, temperature,
			     and pressure.  One important question in regards to folding/unfolding 
			     is whether different external influences change the folding
			      mechanisms.</p>
