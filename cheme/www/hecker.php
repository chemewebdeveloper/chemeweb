		<p style="margin:-250px 0px">Dr. Hecker’s research at BYU has included exploring
		 the reaction kinetics and surface properties of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, 
		 catalytic NOx reduction, coal char oxidation, rocket propellants, and oil shale. 
		 He has recently initiated work on the kinetic modeling of FT synthesis. Previous
		  to coming to BYU he worked for 2 years at Chevron Research Corporation in catalyst 
		  development where his work led to 3 patents and 1.5 years at Dow Chemical Company in 
		  coal desulfurization and char pyrolysis. He spent a 6 month sabbatical leave in Australia
		   in 1992 doing research at the University of Newcastle and Macquarie University. He has 
		   served as Counselor to the BYU chapter of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers 
		   (AIChE) since 1983 and received the national award as the Outstanding Counselor in 1986. 
		   Under his direction the BYU chapter has won the Outstanding Chapter Award from national 
		   AIChE 15 times. In 1985 he received an award as the Outstanding Teacher in the Chemical 
		   Engineering Department. He has served as Secretary-Treasurer and one of 6 founders of 
		   the Western States Catalysis Club and on the national AIChE Student Chapters Committee.</p>
