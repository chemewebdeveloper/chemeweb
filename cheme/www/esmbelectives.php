			<p>Within the technical elective are requirements for "Advanced Engineering"
		 and "Advanced Engineering/Math/Science/Business" courses.  Classes fulfilling
		  these requirements are found below.  Students may petition the department, 
		  through his/her academic advisor, to count courses that are not included, 
		  or that are explicitly excluded, as either engineering or EMSB.  Petitions 
		  are handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<h2>Engineering Elective</h2>
		<p>Courses taken to fulfill the Engineering Elective must meet the ABET 
		definition of "engineering topics" which include "engineering sciences" 
		and "engineering design." The engineering sciences have their roots in 
		mathematics and basic sciences but carry knowledge further toward creative 
		application.  Engineering design is the process of devising a system,
		 component, or process to meet desired needs.</p>
		<p>In general (exceptions are noted below), courses that are 300 level
		or above, which are taught in the departments of Chemical Engineering,
		 Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering,
		  or Mechanical Engineering, may be taken to fulfill the engineering elective. 
		   In addition to these, the following courses also count towards the advanced 
		   engineering elective.</p>
	<h3>Additional courses which fulfill the advanced engineering elective</h3>
			<ul>
	 			<li>CH EN 199R (Co-op/Intership) with approval</li>
	 			<li>CM 302, 320, 335</li>
	 			<li>IT 327, 344, 347, 350, 441, 443, 466, 529, 531, 548, 566</li>
	 			<li>MFG 331, 355, 431, 434, 480, 531, 532, 533, 555, 572, 574, 580.</li>
	 			<li>NDFS 355, 362</li>
	 			 <li>ME 172</li>
	 			 <li>GEOL 330, 521</li>
	 			 <li>ENG T 497R</li>
	 		</ul>
	 <h3>Courses which do not fulfill the advanced engineering elective</h3>
		 <p>The following courses do not fulfill the advanced engineering elective
		  either due to overlap with core chemical engineering courses or lack of 
		  significant "engineering" content.</p>
		  	<ul>
	 			<li>Any seminar course</li>
	 			<li>Any special topics course without petition</li>
	 			<li>CE EN 300A, 300B, 332, 400A, 400B, 400C, 493R, 498R, 555</li>
	 			<li>EC EN 360, 370, 391, 462, 493R, 522R, 542R</li>
	 			<li>ME 312, 321, 340, 373, 422, 495R, 499R, 521, 595R</li>
	 		</ul>
	 <h2>EMSB (Engineering/Math/Science/Business) Elective</h2>
	 	<p>In general (exceptions are noted below), courses that are 300 
	 	level or above, which are "engineering, math, science, or business,"
	 	 may be taken to fulfill EMSB elective.  Business is defined as courses
	 	  taught in the Marriot School of Management.  Math and Science are defined 
	 	  as courses taught in the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences or 
	 	  the College of Life Sciences (with the exception of the Department of 
	 	  Excercise Science).  Engineering (in the EMSB context) is defined as courses 
	 	  taught in the College of Engineering (including the School of Technology). 
	 	   In addition to these, the following courses also count towards the EMSB
	 	    elective.</p>
	 <h3>Additional courses which fulfill the EMSB elective</h3>
	 		<ul>
	 			<li>PHSCS 281</li>
	 			<li>CS 142</li>
	 			<li>EX SC 362, 400</li>
	 			<li>ECON 380, 381</li>
	 			<li>BUSM 201, 241</li>
	 			<li>Any course explicitly included as "Engineering Elective"
	 			 as discussed above</li>
	 		</ul>
	 <h3>Courses which do not fulfill the EMSB elective</h3>
	 	<p>The following courses do not fulfill the EMSB elective due to
	 	 overlap with core chemical engineering courses or because they lack 
	 	 "advanced" topics.</p>
	 	 		<ul>
	 	 			<li>Any seminar course</li>
	 	 			<li>Any special topics course without petition</li>
	 	 			<li>BIOL 347</li>
	 	 			<li>CE EN 300A, 300B, 332, 400A, 400B, 400C, 493R, 498R</li>
	 	 			<li>EC EN 360, 391, 493R, 522R, 542R</li>
	 	 			<li>ME 312, 321, 340, 373, 422, 495R, 499R, 521, 595R</li>
	 	 			<li>CM 491R, 494R</li>
	 	 			<li>FPM 494R</li>
	 	 			<li>INDES 494R</li>
	 	 			<li>IT 391R, 491R, 492R, 515R</li>
	 	 			<li>MFG 490R, 491R</li>
	 	 			<li>TEE 476R, 490R</li>
	 	 		</ul>
	 <h2>Innovation</h2>
	 	<p>Beginning in Fall 2009,  at least 1 technical elective hour must 
	 	be from a course involving a significant learning experience in creativity 
	 	and/or innovation. Such courses are those that teach concepts and require 
	 	a project in which innovation or creativity is demonstrated. These courses 
	 	include CH EN 199R, 400, 498R, CHEM 497R, and other similar courses from 
	 	EMSB departments that are approved by the student's advisor.  Please note
	 	 that simply taking CH EN 199R, 498R or CHEM 497R does not automatically qualify
	 	  as innovation.  The innovative/creative component must be demonstrated.</p>
	<h2>Research Credit, Project Credit, and Academic Internship</h2>
		   <ul>
				<li>CH EN 498R, ChEn 199R, and ENG T 497R may count toward either the 
				Engineering Elective or the EMSB Elective; however, no more than 3 total
				 hours of CH EN 498R, CH EN 199R, and ENG T 497R may be applied to the 
			 	program.</li>
				<li>One hour of mentored learning (research) credit from other 
				engineering departments may count toward the Engineering or EMSB
				 elective (e.g., ME 495R).</li>
				<li>One hour of mentored learning (research) credit from a science 
				department may count toward only the EMSB requirement 
				(e.g., CHEM 497R). </li>
				<li>If one hour of mentored learning from outside the department
				 is applied to the technical elective requirement, then only 2 
				 hours of CH EN 498R, Ch EN 199R, and ENG T 497R may be applied 
				 to the requirement.</li>
