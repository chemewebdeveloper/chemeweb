			<p><span class="first">T</span>he combination of knowledge about  process engineering, math,
			and chemistry obtained in the chemical engineering  curriculum is a versatile preparation 
			that opens a wide variety of opportunities  to graduates. This versatility is one reason why
			chemical engineers have  traditionally been among the highest paid professionals in the engineering
			and science disciplines.</p> <p><img class="personel" nosave="" src="images/undergrad/Refinery.JPG" alt="" 
			align="right" height="157" width="210" /></p> <p><span class="first">C</span>hemical engineers  make a 
			significant difference in our quality of life. Some develop clean,  new energy sources to power society.
			Some develop and produce fertilizers  and other agricultural chemicals to assist in feeding mankind.
			Virtually  all pharmaceuticals are produced by chemical engineers to enhance the life  of millions. 
			Others study and produce biomedical devices and artificial  organs. Still others are involved in development
			and production of new  materials for use in new high-tech products.</p> <p><span>T</span>he petroleum 
			industry is one of the largest employers of chemical engineers, requiring their expertise forthe discovery, production, and refining of petrochemicals 
			including fuels, chemicals, and oils.</p> <p><span class="first">E</span>ngineers produce chemicals ranging in use from  cleaning products to medicines and from
			man-made fibers for clothing and textiles  to plastics for construction and consumer goods.</p> <p><span class="first">M</span>any
			chemical engineers are employed in environmentally related positions,  working on ways to improve air and water quality, 
			to reduce acid rain and  smog, and to recycle and reduce garbage. Additionally, chemical engineers  are employed by universities
			as teachers and researchers and by government  agencies to provide answers for energy, environmental, and defense concerns. 
			Chemical engineers also train to work in the medical, business, and legal  professions.</p> <p><img alt="" nosave=""src="images/undergrad/refine.jpg"
			align="left" height="158" width="210" style="margin-right:10px" />  <span class="first">A</span>lthough chemical engineering career opportunities are diverse,
			job functions  can be categorized more easily. Chemical engineers are usually involved  in research, design, development, production,
			technical sales, or management.</p> <p><span class="first">I</span>n research, they develop new ideas, new products, and new ways to
			produce  existing products more economically and with less environmental impact.  In design, they create the processes that convert
			raw materials into finished  products with emphasis on efficiency, safety, consumer needs, and environmental  protection. The development
			engineer improves existing processes and technology  to better meet changing needs. Production engineering involves processes  and operations.
			Management and technical sales involve decision making  with regard to consumer needs and technical capabilities. Chemical engineers  are creative problem solvers.
			Their careers are rewarding not only from  an intellectual and financial view, but also from a personal perspective.  Their solutions 
			provide a better lifestyle for mankind.</p> <div align="center"> <object height="344" width="425"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/P3B4ocfAXRw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"
