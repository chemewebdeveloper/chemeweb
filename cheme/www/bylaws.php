			 <h2><strong>Article I: PURPOSES </strong></h2> 				 
				<p>The BYU Chemical Engineering Alumni Society 
				(hereafter called the Society) is organized to create and nurture fellowship among and provide service to the alumni,
				to the BYU Chemical Engineering Department (hereafter called the Department) and students of the Department, and to the
				community at large, in support of the chemical engineering profession. The Society will assist in promoting the purposes 
				of the Department, raise funds in its support (where appropriate), encourage continuing interest in the Department and 
				perpetuate the Department's contributions to the lives of its alumni.</p>
			 <h2><strong> Article II: MEMBERSHIP</strong></h2> 				
				<p>All BYU chemical engineering graduates and current and past faculty members of the Department shall be eligible for 
				membership, pending appropriate application and payment of dues, if required by the board of directors. Honorary membership 
				shall be conferred upon a unanimous vote of the board of directors and agreement of the one to be so honored.</p> 				 
			 <h2><strong>   Article III: MEETINGS OF THE SOCIETY</strong></h2> 				
					<p><em>Section 1</em>: The annual meeting of the Society shall be held on the Friday evening of BYU Homecoming Week. 
					Other meetings of the Society, which may include special meetings for the transaction of the Society's business, may 
					be held at times and places set by the Chairman.</p> 				 
					<p><em>Section 2</em>: A quorum for the transaction of business at any annual or special meeting of the Society 
					shall consist of the members present. Voting shall be by members actually present; there shall be no voting by proxy 
					at such meetings.</p> 				
			<h2><strong> Article IV: BOARD OF DIRECTORS</strong></h2> 				 
					<p><em>Section 1</em>: The governing body of the Society shall be the board of directors. It shall have charge
					and control of the affairs, funds, and properties of the Society, establish its policies with respect to its fiscal 
					and business affairs, and determine the services and programs to be rendered by the Society.</p> 				
					<p><em>Section 2</em>: The board of directors shall be comprised of nine directors, from the Society's membership.</p> 			
					<p><em>Section 3</em>: The term of office of each elected board member shall be three years, starting on the day following
					his/her election. To help assure continuity on the board, terms of office shall be staggered, so that three board members 
					are replaced each year.</p> 				 
					<p><em> Section 4</em> : A nominating committee, appointed by the chairman (see Article V), will annually prepare a list
					of candidates for nomination to fill vacancies on the board. The nominating committee will solicit recommendations from
					the membership of the Society, in a manner that assures that most if not all of the membership has an opportunity to
					participate in the nominating process. From this list, the committee will present the names of at least two candidates per
					vacancy to the chairman for approval. The nominating committee will confirm with each of the candidates that they would be
					willing to serve on the board if elected. The slate of candidates will be presented for a vote by e-mail, allowing sufficient 
					time to tabulate the vote prior to the annual meeting of the Society. Each member will vote for three of the candidates. The 
					counting method will assure that each member does not cast more than the approved number of votes. The three nominees with the
					most votes will be selected to replace the three whose terms have expired. The winning candidates will be announced in the
					annual meeting.</p> 				
					<p><em> Section 5</em> : In the event of a vacancy in the board of directors by reason of death, resignation, failure to act, 
					or otherwise, the board may fill the vacancy for the duration of the unfulfilled term.</p> 				
					<p><em>Section 6</em>: Meetings of the board of directors for the transaction of the business of the Society shall be held 
					on call of the chairman, or a majority of the board of directors. At least three such meetings shall be held each year.
					Special meetings may be called by the chairman or at the request of a majority of the board of directors. Notices of regular or
					special meetings shall be mailed or otherwise communicated to each member of the board at his or her residence or business at
					least ten days prior to the date of the meeting. However, failure to give said notice shall not invalidate the action of the
					board of directors at any meeting at which a quorum is present. At all meetings of the board of directors, the presence of a 
					majority of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the vote of a majority of those present 
					shall be necessary for the conducting of any business.</p> 				 <p><em> Section 7</em> : Standing and ad-hoc board 
					committees may be organized by the board from time to time to conduct the business of the Society. After consulting with members
					of the board, the chairman and vice-chairman (see Article V) shall appoint chairmen of all standing and ad-hoc committees.</p>

					election. The vice-chairman shall succeed to the office of chairman.</p> 				 
					<p><em> Section 3</em> : A nominating committee, appointed by the chairman, chaired by the vice-chairman and approved 
					by the board, will prepare a list of at least two candidates to replace the vice-chairman when he/she succeeds to the chairmanship.
					The nominating committee will confirm with each of the approved candidates that they would be willing to serve as the vice-chairman and
					subsequently as the chairman, if they are elected. From this approved list, the Society shall elect the vice-chairman by e-mail, allowing
					sufficient time to tabulate the vote prior to the annual meeting of the Society. The counting method will assure that each member does not
					vote more than once. The newly elected vice-chairman will be announced in the annual meeting.</p> 				
					<p><em> Section 4</em> : No term of office shall be longer than two years.&nbsp; However, in the event a qualified successor is not elected,
					an officer shall continue to hold office until a qualified successor is elected and takes office.</p> 				 
					<p><em> Section 5</em> : The duties of the officers shall be such as customarily apply to such positions subject to any specific
					requirements of law, the constitution, or these bylaws.</p> 				 <p>A. The chairman shall preside over the Society and the
					board of directors and shall be a voting ex officio member of all committees of the Society.</p> 				 
					<p>B. The vice-chairman shall preside in the absence of the chairman. The vice-chairman shall also chair the nominating committee of the board.</p> 		
			<h2><strong> Section VI: COMMITTEES</strong></h2>

					chairman and vice-chairman and the Department Alumni Committee, in which agreement will be reached on needed Department support.</p>

					<p><em> Section 2</em> : Prior to each annual meeting of the Society, the board shall set full annual dues, if needed.</p>

			than the last scheduled meeting of the board in the year preceding.</p> 				 
			<h2><strong>Article X: USE OF MEMBERSHIP LIST</strong></h2>

			<h2><strong>   Article XI: AWARDS</strong></h2> 				 
					<p>The board of directors shall establish such awards as are deemed appropriate to promote the objectives of the Society. The award(s) selected 
					will recognize outstanding contributions of alumni in selected areas of service in the chemical engineering profession, the Chemical Engineering
					Department, student support and community service. (An example of this is the traditional "Outstanding Alumnus Award," which gives particular 
					emphasis to excellence in the chemical engineering profession.) The award(s) will be presented at the annual meeting of the Society.</p> 			
			<h2><strong>Article XII:&nbsp; AMENDMENTS </strong></h2><p><em>Section 1:</em> The by-laws may be amended at any time by a vote of a majority of the members of the
			board of directors attending a regular or special meeting called for said purpose, provided a written notice of any proposed change in these by-laws shall be sent
			to all members of the board at least twenty days prior to said meeting. Such amendments will only become a permanent part of the by-laws following a ratifying vote
			in the annual meeting of the Society.</p> 				 <p><em> Section 2:</em> The by-laws may be also be amended by a petition signed by at least 50 members of 
			the Society and approved by a vote of the Society in the annual meeting.</p>
