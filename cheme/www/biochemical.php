			<p>Dr. Lewis is conducting research on the conversion of biomass to biofuels. 
			 Specifically, he is focusing on the biological conversion of syngas (hydrogen,
			  carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide) to biofuels.  Syngas is generated via
			   the gasification of biomass.  The research involves (1) assessing the effects
			    of syngas impurities on the biological conversion process, (2) modeling 
			    the effects of syngas composition on enzyme efficiency, (3) optimizing 
			    the reactor design for the most efficient syngas conversion, and (4) 
			    developing methods to incorporate multiple biological processes to obtain
			     the most sustainable overall process.</p>
