<h3>Combustion</h3>
<br />
<br />
	<p colspan="2">Combustion is the major source of energy in modern society 
	with the majority of electric power production, residential and industrial 
	heating, and transportation arising from combustion processes. Active experimental
	 and computation research is being conducted in areas such as coal combustion and
	  gasification, wildland fires, ash deposition, and turbulence chemistry interactions.
	    This research is conducted as part of the Advanced Combustion Engineering Research 
	    Center <a href="http://www-acerc.byu.edu">(ACERC)</a>.</p>

			<p>Coal gasification is being explored worldwide as a method to 
			produce liquid fuels, chemicals, and electricity. The advantage 
			of gasification is that it provides a pure CO2 stream for sequestration.
			 Our projects are to provide the fundamental kinetic parameters of coal
			  gasification at high temperatures and pressures, along with physical 
			  properties of the corresponding chars. The BYU Pressurized Flat-Flame
			   Burner can reach conditions of 15 atm and 2000 K.</p>

			<p>Direct numerical simulation (DNS) is a powerful computational 
			technique providing high-fidelity data of turbulence-chemistry interactions.
			  Turbulence is characterized by a wide range of time and length scales 
			  requiring high grid resolution resulting in high computational cost. 
			   Turbulent flow simulations require subgrid models to account for
			    unresolved turbulent structures and their effect on transport.</p>

			<p>Full resolution of three-dimensional turbulence fields is very 
			costly from a computational viewpoint. The ODT model fully resolves 
			a flow field along a notional line-of-sight. Turbulent advection is
			 simulated through stochastic eddy events that are implemented through
			  grid rearrangements via triplet maps. These eddy events occur with a 
			  given size, location, and frequency that depends on the evolution of 
			  the velocity field itself, in a way that mimimics that turbulent energy
			   cascade. The figure at turleft shows the temperature field for a buoyant 
			   ethylene fire.</p>
